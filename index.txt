Kanagala Bharath kumar 

I am fresher to Northwest Missouri State University. I opted masters in applied computer science for these spring.

 I am from India and done my under graduation  at Koneru Lakshmaia University in computer science engineering on may of 2018 which is located in vijayawada of Andhra Pradesh State. I did my ug project on image processing. my hobbies are playing cricket and listening songs.

My short time goal is to complete my master and gain job in areas of machine learning. But once in my life i would like to have my own restaurant with cricket nets to play.

I am interested in skydiving...

Thank you all.
